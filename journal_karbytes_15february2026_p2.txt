Before I make changes to any public GitHub repositories which are either owned by GitHub user @karlinarayberinger or else by GitHub user @karbytessupporter, I will (a) sign into GitHub as @informationcrystals and (b) first clone the public GitHub repository whose Uniform Resource Locator is as follows and as that repository is configured at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 14_FEBRUARY_2026:

https://github.com/karbytessupporter/karbytes_wayback_machine_saves_precision_batches_extension_1

Then I will set the cloned repository view settings to private and add updated files to that private repository (which is also named karbytes_wayback_machine_saves_precision_batches_extension_1). 

After those files are added to the private @informationcrystals-owned GitHub repository named karbytes_wayback_machine_saves_precision_batches_extension_1, karbytes will set that repository to archive (i.e. read-only) mode and download all of its file contents as a zip file (which karbytes will rename as karbytes_wayback_machine_saves_precision_batches_extension_1_16february2026.zip).

I will delete the file named karbytes_wayback_machine_saves_precision_batches_extension_1_14ebruary2026.zip on karbytes' Desktop and on karbytes' USB flash drive and replace that file with karbytes_wayback_machine_saves_precision_batches_extension_1_16february2026.zip on each of those devices.

The same essential process (from karbytes' perspective) as described above will be used to make "up to date" @informationcrystals-owned private and public GitHub repository which are also part of karbytes2026_0. 

Namely, the following zip files will be downloaded from @informationcrystals-owned private GitHub repositories which are clones of some @karlinarayberinger-owned public and private GitHub repositories:

karbytes_basement_48-main.zip // private, assumed to be finalized (i.e. static)

KARBYTES_FOR_LIFE_BLOG-main_16february2026.zip // public, assumed to be "open to future edits" (i.e. growing)
