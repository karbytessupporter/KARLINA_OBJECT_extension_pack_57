While "on hiatus", it occurred to me that there is at least one error in the following web page (and that error is a miscount of the total number of zip files in karbytes_nexus_[14feb2026]): 

https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2026_0/

After the current "hiatus period" ends, karbytes will attempt to correct all errors in the latest version of karbytes.

According to karbytes, the finalization date of karbytes2026_0 is expected to be no later than 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 31_DECEMBER_2026.

After the current "hiatus period" ends, karbytes expects to have burned (and read-tested) at least two M_DISC copies of karbytes_nexus_[16FEB2026].

It is meant to be inferred that the current "hiatus period" is set by karbytes to end at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 13_FEBRUARY_2026.

It is meant to be inferred that the next "hiatus period" is set by karbytes to start at 12:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 17_FEBRUARY_2026.
