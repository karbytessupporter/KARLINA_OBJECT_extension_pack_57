It has come to my attention that there are some errors in the HTML source code of the latest karbytes micro-directory KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack "chapter" (among other identified errors in that micro-directory). 

I expect to have that micro-directory totally devoid of errors by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 18_FEBRUARY_2026.
